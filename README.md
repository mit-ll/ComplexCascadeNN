# ComplexCascadeNN (complex split-activation skip-layers feedforward neural network)
Please note the license and disclaimers in this README

# Description

This is a matlab class intended to replace feedforwardnet which takes only real inputs.
When complex inputs are separated into [real; imag], the ability to do complex operations 
typical of signal processing is made more difficult by introducing unnecessary degrees of 
freedom.  complexcascade class directly implements complex neural networks with either complex
activation functions (e.g. tanh) or split real/imag activation functions 
i.e., f(z) =  f(real(z)) + 1i * f(imag(z)).

Most non-linear problems will get stuck in local minima when using gradient techniques, so 
the preferred method is to use a blended Hessian/gradient approach (Levenberg Marquardt).  
Implementation of LM in this code follows the notation in the companion paper.

Also implemented here is Bayesian Regularization.  Bayesian Regularization (MacKay) uses a 
mahalanobis distance metric that combines the network error with the netowrk weights norm, 
adapting the estimate of the variance of each at each step.  The approach uses an estimate 
of the number of parameters in the network problem.

Skip connections enable feed forwardnets to easily implement signal subtraction.  They 
also help the issue of vanishing gradients when backpropagting errors from the metric.
