# ComplexCascadeNN (complex split-activation skip-layers feedforward neural network)
Pleaes note the license and disclaimers in this README

# Description

This is a matlab class intended to replace feedforwardnet which takes only real inputs.
When complex inputs are separated into [real; imag], the ability to do complex operations 
typical of signal processing is made more difficult by introducing unnecessary degrees of 
freedom.  complexcascade class directly implements complex neural networks with either complex
activation functions (e.g. tanh) or split real/imag activation functions 
i.e., f(z) =  f(real(z)) + 1i * f(imag(z)).

Most non-linear problems will get stuck in local minima when using gradient techniques, so 
the preferred method is to use a blended Hessian/gradient approach (Levenberg Marquardt).

Bayesian Regularization (MacKay) uses a mahalanobis distance metric that combines the network
error with the netowrk weights norm, adapting the estimate of the variance of each at each 
step.  The approach uses an estimate of the number of parameters in the network problem.

Cascade architecture adds connections from the input directly to deeper 
layers and also connections skipping layers to benefit signal subtraction problems.
